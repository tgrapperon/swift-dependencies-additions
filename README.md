# Dependencies Additions

A companion library to Point-Free's `swift-dependencies` that provides higher-level dependencies.

## On the menu // Rewrite this
`Dependencies` is a fantastic library that helps managing your app's dependencies in a similar fashion SwiftUI handles its `Environment`.

TODO: Reword this
// `Dependencies` already ships with many dependencies, like `clock`, `uuid`, `date`, etc., but its fundamental nature prevents it to ship with too many built-in dependencies.
// `Dependencies Additions` intends to bridge the gap between these very fundamental dependencies and every-day development on Apple's platforms.

The library proposes a few low-level additional dependencies to interface with:
- `BundleInfo`
- `Codable`
- `Compression`
- `Logger`
- `PersistentContainer`
- `UserDefaults`

It also ships with more experimental and higher level abstractions for:
- `AppStorage`, that proposes an `@Dependency.AppStorage` which mimics `SwiftUI`s `@AppStorage`, but usable from your model and or any concurrent context.
- `CoreData`, [TODO]
- `Notifications`, that exposes notifications under the form of typed `AsyncSequence`s.
- `SwiftUI`'s `Environment`, that republishes `SwiftUI`'s `Environment` values in your model.

Each dependency is self contained in its own module, so you can import only the ones that you need "Ã  la carte".

## Additional Dependencies

### `BundleInfo`

This very simple dependency exposes a `BundleInfo` type that allows to simply retrieve a few `info.plist`-related fields, like the `bundleIdentifier` or the app's `version`. 

For example:
```swift
@Dependency(\.bundleInfo.bundleIdentifier) var bundleIdentifier
```
As this value is often used to prefix identifiers, having this value exposed as a dependency allows you control it at distance when testing for example.

### Codable
The library exposes two dependencies to helps with coding or decoding of your `Codable` types.
```swift
@Dependency(\.encode) var encode
@Dependency(\.decode) var decode

struct Point: Codable {
  var x: Double
  var y: Double
}

let point = Point(x: 12, y: 35)
let encoded = try encode(point) // A `Data` value
let decoded = try decode(Point.self, from: encoded) // A `Point` value
```
As you can see, the API is very similar to JSON or PropertyList encoder and decoder.

By default, `encode` and `decode` are producing/consuming `JSON` data.

### Compression
In the same fashion as `encode` and `decode`, the library exposes two
dependencies to compress and decompress `Data`, using Apple's Compression framework:
```swift
@Dependency(\.compress) var compress
@Dependency(\.decompress) var decompress

let uncompressed = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet".data(using: .utf8)!
let compressed = try compress(uncompressed, using: .lzfse)
let decompressed = try decompress(compressed, using: .lzfse)
```
They can also be called from async contexts, where a more efficient
variant is used:
```swift
let compressed = try await compress(uncompressed)
let decompressed = try await decompress(compressed)
```

By default, `compress` and `decompress` are using the `.zlib` algorithm.

### Logger

### PersistentContainer

### ProcessInfo

### UserDefaults

### `swift-dependencies` extensions

#### Date generator
#### RNG

## Higher-level dependencies
The library proposes a few experimental higher level dependencies. They are currenly "underscored", meaning that their APIs are not finalized. They may be extracted into their own library in the future.

### AppStorage
```swift
@Dependency.AppStorage("username") var username: String = "Anonymous"
```
The API follows SwiftUI's `AppStorage`, but is backed by `@Dependency(\.userDefaults)`.
It can operate in your model and be accessed from async contexts. If the same `key` are used, it can inter-operate with `SwiftUI`'s own `AppStorage`.
The projected value is an `AsyncStream<Value>` of this user preference's values. They can be observed from any async context:
```swift
@Dependency.AppStorage("isSoundEnabled") var isSoundEnabled: Bool = false

for await isSoundEnabled in $isSoundEnabled {
  await isSoundEnabled ? audioEngine.start() : audioEngine.stop()
}
```
### Notifications
// TODO: Change this example, or propose an UIDevice dependency!

This dependency allows to expose `Notification`s as typed `AsyncSequence`s.
```swift
extension Notifications {
  /// A typed `Notification` that publishes the current device's battery level.
  @MainActor
  public var batterLevelDidChange: NotificationOf<Float> {
    .init(UIDevice.batteryLevelDidChangeNotification) { notification in
      UIDevice.current.batteryLevel
    }
  }
}
```
You can then expose this notification with a dedicated property wrapper:
```swift
@Dependency.Notification(\.batteryLevelDidChange) var batteryLevel
```
The exposed value is an async sequence of `Float` representing the `batteryLevel`:
```swift
for await level in batteryLevel {
  if level < 0.2 {
    self.isLowPowerModeEnabled = true
  }
}
```
